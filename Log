I have made an epilepsy generator and it a good step to achieving my goal but i will probably remove it in some capacity as it is one of my core thing. 

week 4 /week 5
So i have made most things work and i fill done but i have bin working on a sidebar thing for my tanks and to make it so you can move and it follows. but also i have made that you can change pictures of tanks and how you do it is that you buy upgrades to change tank and the first tank upgrade is when you have bought 10.
